# GHSDD
A chrome extension to download any sub-directory or file from a Github repo .

## Problem 

Many a times you only want to download a subdirectory of a repo , for example when looking for a library you just want 
download the sample given along with it and not the whole repo , currently github's ui only provides downloading individual 
file or entire repo as zip and not subdirectory , this extension solves this problem, just paste sub-directory's github url 
it downloads(not clone) that for you .

## Usage 
1. Download [zip] (https://github.com/charany1/GHSDD/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip it.
3. Go to **chrome://extensions** in your browser. 
4. Check **Developer Mode**.
4. Click on **Load Unpacked Extensions** and select directory containing unzipped files.
5. You should see GHSDD in your extensions page and among extensions in top pannel.
6. Test : Paste https://github.com/facebook/stetho/tree/master/stetho-sample in popup and get zip.
